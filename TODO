* Improved configuration syntax allowing multiple listening ports/address per daemon.
* Move from select() to poll() or epoll() to support more than FD_SETSIZE / 2 connections
* HTTP interface for backend servers to determine remote IP and port of connection
* Output buffering and out of band TCP data proxying -- I haven't seen a case where the lack of this has caused any issues yet.
