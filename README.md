SNI Proxy
=========

Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname contained in
the initial request of the TCP session. This enables HTTPS name-based virtual
hosting to separate backend servers without installing the private key on the
proxy machine.

Features
--------
+ Name-based proxying of HTTPS without decrypting traffic. No keys or
  certificates required.
+ Supports both TLS and HTTP protocols.
+ Supports IPv4, IPv6 and Unix domain sockets for both back end servers and
  listeners.
+ Supports multiple listening sockets per instance.
+ Supports HAProxy proxy protocol to propagate original source address to
  backend servers.

Usage
-----

    Usage: sniproxy [-c <config>] [-f] [-n <max file descriptor limit>] [-V]
        -c  configuration file, defaults to /etc/sniproxy.conf
        -f  run in foreground, do not drop privileges
        -n  specify file descriptor limit
        -V  print the version of SNIProxy and exit


Installation
------------

For Debian or Fedora based Linux distributions see building packages below.

**Prerequisites**

+ Autotools (autoconf, automake, gettext and libtool)
+ libev4, libpcre and libudns development headers
+ Perl and cURL for test suite

**Install**

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
    install sniproxy ./

**To Run**

    sudo ./sniproxy -c ./path_to_config_file -f


Configuration Syntax
--------------------

    user daemon

    pidfile /tmp/sniproxy.pid

    error_log {
        syslog daemon
        priority notice
    }

    listener 127.0.0.1:443 {
        protocol tls
        table TableName

        # Specify a server to use if the initial client request doesn't contain
        # a hostname
        fallback 192.0.2.5:443
    }

    table TableName {
        # Match exact request hostnames
        example.com 192.0.2.10:4343
        # If port is not specified the listener port will be used
        example.net [2001:DB8::1:10]
        # Or use regular expression to match
        .*\\.com    [2001:DB8::1:11]:443
        # Combining regular expression and wildcard will resolve the hostname
        # client requested and proxy to it
        .*\\.edu    *:443
    }

DNS Resolution
--------------

Using hostnames or wildcard entries in the configuration requires sniproxy to
be built with [UDNS](http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/udns.html). SNIProxy will still
build without UDNS, but these features will be unavailable.

UDNS uses a single UDP socket for all queries, so it is recommended you use a
local caching DNS resolver (with a single socket each DNS query is protected by
spoofing by a single 16 bit query ID, which makes it relatively easy to spoof).
